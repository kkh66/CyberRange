<div id="active-directory" class="section-content">
    <section>
        <h2>What is Active Directory (AD)?</h2>
        <p>Active Directory (AD) is a system used by companies to organize and manage the information about their
            network. It's like a huge address book that tracks users, computers, printers, and other devices in the
            company.</p>
        <p>AD decides who has access to what on the company's network. For example, when you log into your work
            computer, AD checks your username and password to make sure you are allowed to use it and access files or
            applications.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">In short:</span> Active Directory controls access, security, and organization in a
            company's network, ensuring only authorized users can do certain things.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why is Active Directory Often Targeted by Hackers?</h2>
        <p>Active Directory is a major target for hackers because it controls access to everything in the network. If a
            hacker gains control over AD, they can access files, steal data, and even take down systems.</p>
        <p><span class="important">Why do hackers target AD?</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It’s the key to everything:</strong> AD controls access to all systems, files, and services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Admin access:</strong> The people managing AD have powerful access to the whole network, making
                it a prime target for hackers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gateway to other systems:</strong> AD can be used to access other parts of the network.</li>
            <li><strong>High-value credentials:</strong> AD stores usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data that
                hackers can steal to impersonate users.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="highlight">In short:</span> AD is like the central control hub for everything on a company's
            network, making it a very attractive target for cybercriminals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Does Active Directory Authentication Work?</h2>
        <p>When you try to log into a computer on a network, AD checks your identity to make sure you're authorized to
            use it. Here's a simplified breakdown:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> You type in your username and password.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The computer asks AD to verify your credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> AD checks the password and either grants or denies access based on a match.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="highlight">There are two main methods of authentication:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kerberos:</strong> This method gives you a special pass or "ticket" to access systems, like a
                school ID that proves you're allowed in.
            </li>
            <li><strong>NTLM:</strong> An older method where your password is checked each time you log in or access
                something.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="highlight">Important Note:</span> If someone steals your password or your authentication ticket,
            they might impersonate you to access sensitive systems and data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What you will learn in this module</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Act as real world attacker</strong> You will be using certain tools to perform attack on another
                victim machine
            </li>
            <li><strong>Admin access:</strong> The people managing AD have powerful access to the whole network, making
                it a prime target for hackers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gateway to other systems:</strong> AD can be used to access other parts of the network.</li>
            <li><strong>High-value credentials:</strong> AD stores usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data that
                hackers can steal to impersonate users.

        <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong> Active Directory makes sure only authorized users can log in and access
            important systems. If hackers manage to steal your login details or authentication tickets, they could break
            into your account and cause serious damage.</p>

<!-- RDP Section -->
<div id="rdp" class="section-content">
    <section>
        <h2>What is RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)?</h2>
        <p>RDP is a technology that allows you to access and control another computer remotely over the internet or a
            network. It’s like being able to sit at your desk at home but still use your work computer in the
            office.</p>
        <p>For example, if you're working from home and need a program that’s only on your office computer, you can use
            RDP to connect and work on it remotely.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Key point:</span> RDP allows you to control another computer as if you were sitting
            right in front of it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why is RDP Often Targeted by Hackers?</h2>
        <p>RDP is a common target for hackers because it allows remote access to systems. If an attacker gains access to
            an RDP session, they can take control of the target computer and its data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weak Passwords:</strong> Many RDP attacks come from weak passwords that are easy for hackers to
                guess.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exposed RDP Ports:</strong> Sometimes companies leave RDP ports open to the internet, making it
                easy for attackers to find and exploit.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Unpatched Systems:</strong> If the RDP software is not kept up to date, vulnerabilities can be
                exploited.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="info-box">
        <p><strong>Quick RDP Summary:</strong> RDP allows you to remotely access computers, but if not properly secured,
            it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.</p>
